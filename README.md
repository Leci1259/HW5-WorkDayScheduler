# HW5-WorkDayScheduler

## Description
In this project I am given starter HTML and CSS code and tasked to transform it into a work day scheduler. I will allow the user to type in a task into a specific time block and save it to use for reference later.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## My Process
1. I added/formatted the time blocks to the HTML with the assistance of Bootstrap
2. I added some icons to the page using Font Awesome
3. I styled the page, Halloween themed using CSS
4. I linked the HTML to JQuery and Moment.JS
5. I added today's date to the page using Moment.js
6. I set up a for loop for change the time blocks based on past,present, and future.
7. I created a function to save the time block contents and data attribute on save button click
8. I created a function to render the save contents to the page
