# HW5-WorkDayScheduler

## Description
In this project I will allow the user to type in a task into a specific time block and save it to use for reference later.

## Technologies Used
CSS, HTML,Javascript, Moment.js

## My Process
1. I added/formatted the time blocks to the HTML with the assistance of Bootstrap
2. I added some icons to the page using Font Awesome
3. I styled the page, Halloween themed using CSS
4. I linked the HTML to JQuery and Moment.JS
5. I added today's date to the page using Moment.js
6. I set up a for loop for change the time blocks based on past,present, and future.
7. I created a function to save the time block contents and data attribute on save button click
8. I created a function to render the save contents to the page
